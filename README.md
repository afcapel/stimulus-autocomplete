# Stimulus Autocomplete controller

This is a tiny stimulus controller (1.5kB gzipped) to make a selection from a
list of results fetched from the server.

## Installation

`yarn add stimulus-autocomplete`

## Usage

Load your stimulus application as usual and the register the autocomplete
controller with it:

```
import { Application } from 'stimulus'
import { definitionsFromContext } from 'stimulus/webpack-helpers'
import { Autocomplete } from 'stimulus-autocomplete'

const application = Application.start()

const context = require.context('controllers', true, /.js$/)
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context))

application.register('autocomplete', Autocomplete)
```

To use the autocomplete, you need some markup as this:

```html
<div data-controller="autocomplete" data-autocomplete-url="/birds/search">
  <input type="text" data-target="autocomplete.input"/>
  <input type="hidden" name="bird_id" data-target="autocomplete.hidden"/>
  <ul data-target="autocomplete.results"></ul>
</div>
```

The component makes a request to the `data-autocomplete-url` to fetch results for
the contents of the input field. The server must answer with an html fragment:

```html
<li role="option" data-autocomplete-value="1">Blackbird</li>
<li role="option" data-autocomplete-value="2">Bluebird</li>
<li role="option" data-autocomplete-value="3">Mockingbird</li>
```

If the controller has a `hidden` target, that field will be updated with the value
of the selected option. Otherwise, the search text field will be updated.

## Events

* `autocomplete.change` fires when the users selects a new value from the autocomplete
field. The event `detail` contains the `value` and `textValue` properties of the
selected result.
* `loadstart` fires before the autocomplete fetches the results from the server.
* `load` fires when results have been successfully loaded.
* `error` fires when there's an error fetching the results.
* `loadend` fires when the request for results ends, successfully or not.
* `toggle` fires when the results element is shown or hidden.

## Optional parameters

* `min-length` set the minimum number of charaters required to make an autocomplete request.
* `active-class` set which class is used when an element is selected. Can be a list of classes.  Default: `active`.

For example:

```html
<div data-controller="autocomplete" data-autocomplete-min-length="2" data-autocomplete-active-class="bg-blue-200 text-blue-800">
</div>
```
